The optee_os git, contains the source code for the TEE in Linux using the ARM® TrustZone® technology.
This component meets the GlobalPlatform TEE System Architecture specification. It also provides the 
TEE Internal core API v1.1 as defined by the GlobalPlatform TEE Standard for the development of Trusted
Applications. For a general overview of OP-TEE and to find out how to contribute, please see the Notice.md file.

The Trusted OS is accessible from the Rich OS (Linux or [VxWorks](https://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks/) ) 
using the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API Specification v1.0, which also is used to trigger secure execution of 
applications within the TEE.
